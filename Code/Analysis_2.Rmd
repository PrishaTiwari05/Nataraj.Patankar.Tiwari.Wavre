## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
EV_Registrations_PW <- read_excel(
  path = here("Data/Raw/2016-2023 LDV Registration Data.xlsx"),
  col_names = TRUE
)

Fuel_Stations_PW <- read.csv(
file = here("Data/Raw/Fuel_Stations_Historical_Data.csv"),
stringsAsFactors = TRUE
)


```

## Data cleaning and filtering of EV registration

```{r}
EV_Registrations_Subset_PW <- EV_Registrations_PW %>%
  select(`Year`, `State`, `Electric (EV)`, `Plug-In Hybrid Electric (PHEV)`)

EV_Registrations_Subset_PW <- EV_Registrations_Subset_PW %>%
  arrange(Year)

```

## Data cleaning and filtering of charging stations

```{r}

# Keep only the required columns
Fuel_Stations_PW <- Fuel_Stations_PW[, c("Station.Name", "State", "Latitude", "Longitude", "Open.Date")]

Fuel_Stations_PW$Open.Date <- dmy(Fuel_Stations_PW$Open.Date)

Fuel_Stations_PW$Open.Date <- year(Fuel_Stations_PW$Open.Date)

Fuel_Stations_PW <- subset(Fuel_Stations_PW, Open.Date >= 2016 & Open.Date <= 2023)

# First, ensure everything is uppercase and trimmed
Fuel_Stations_PW$State <- toupper(trimws(Fuel_Stations_PW$State))

# Create a lookup: abbreviation → full name
state_abbr <- state.abb
state_names <- state.name

# Add DC manually
state_abbr <- c(state_abbr, "DC")
state_names <- c(state_names, "District of Columbia")

# Map the abbreviations to full names
Fuel_Stations_PW$State <- state_names[match(Fuel_Stations_PW$State, state_abbr)]
```

## Data Wrangling

```{r}

# Adding a new column with EV + PHEV count. 
EV_Registrations_Subset_PW$`Total EVs` <- 
  EV_Registrations_Subset_PW$`Electric (EV)` + 
  EV_Registrations_Subset_PW$`Plug-In Hybrid Electric (PHEV)`

```

```{r}

Station_Counts <- Fuel_Stations_PW %>%
  group_by(Open.Date, State) %>%
  summarise(Number_of_Stations = n(), .groups = 'drop')

```

```{r}

# 1. Summarize station counts by Year and State
Fuel_Stations_Summary <- Fuel_Stations_PW %>%
  group_by(Open.Date, State) %>%
  summarise(Number_of_Stations = n(), .groups = 'drop') %>%
  rename(Year = Open.Date)  # Rename for joining

# 2. Select required columns from EV registrations
EV_Summary <- EV_Registrations_Subset_PW %>%
  select(Year, State, `Total EVs`)

# 3. Join on Year and State
Fuel_Station_and_Registrations_Combined <- left_join(
  Fuel_Stations_Summary,
  EV_Summary,
  by = c("Year", "State")
)

```

##Putting processed data into folder
```{r}

write.csv(EV_Summary, "Data/Processed/EV_Summary.csv", row.names = FALSE)

write.csv(Fuel_Stations_Summary, "Data/Processed/Fuel_Stations_Summary.csv", row.names = FALSE)

```


##Data analysis and linear regression
```{r}
# Step 1: Clean data
df <- Fuel_Station_and_Registrations_Combined %>%
  filter(!is.na(`Total EVs`), !is.na(Number_of_Stations)) %>%
  rename(Total_EVs = `Total EVs`)

# Step 2: Estimate EV registration growth for each state
ev_projections <- df %>%
  group_by(State) %>%
  do({
    model <- lm(Total_EVs ~ Year, data = .)
    new_years <- data.frame(Year = 2024:2026)
    preds <- predict(model, newdata = new_years)
    data.frame(State = unique(.$State), Year = new_years$Year, Total_EVs = preds)
  }) %>%
  ungroup()

# Step 3: Predict Number of Stations for projected EVs
station_predictions <- df %>%
  group_by(State) %>%
  do({
    model <- lm(Number_of_Stations ~ Total_EVs, data = .)
    new_data <- ev_projections %>% filter(State == unique(.$State))
    new_data$Predicted_Stations <- predict(model, newdata = new_data)
    new_data
  }) %>%
  ungroup()

# Step 4: Final output
Predictions_2024_2026 <- station_predictions %>%
  select(State, Year, Total_EVs, Predicted_Stations)

head(Predictions_2024_2026)
```

##Graph plotting
```{r}

# Combine original with future predictions
historical_data <- Fuel_Station_and_Registrations_Combined %>%
  select(State, Year, `Total EVs`, Number_of_Stations) %>%
  mutate(Source = "Historical")

predicted_data <- station_predictions %>%
  rename(Number_of_Stations = Predicted_Stations) %>%
  mutate(Source = "Projected")

combined_plot_data <- bind_rows(
  historical_data,
  predicted_data
)

ggplot(combined_plot_data, aes(x = `Total EVs`, y = Number_of_Stations, color = Source)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~ State, scales = "free") +
  labs(
    title = "EV Stations vs. Total EV Registrations (2016–2026)",
    x = "Total EV Registrations",
    y = "Number of EV Stations",
    color = "Data Type"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(strip.text = element_text(face = "bold", size = 10))
