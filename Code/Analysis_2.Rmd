## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

#Data import
```{r}
EV_Registrations_PW <- read_excel(
  path = here("Data/Raw/2016-2023 LDV Registration Data.xlsx"),
  col_names = TRUE
)

Fuel_Stations_PW <- read.csv(
file = here("Data/Raw/Fuel_Stations_Historical_Data.csv"),
stringsAsFactors = TRUE
)
```

## EV registration: Data cleaning and filtering of 

```{r}
EV_Registrations_Subset_PW <- EV_Registrations_PW %>%
  select(Year, State, `Electric (EV)`, `Plug-In Hybrid Electric (PHEV)`) %>%
  arrange(Year) %>%
  mutate(`Total_EV` = `Electric (EV)` + `Plug-In Hybrid Electric (PHEV)`)

```

## Data cleaning and filtering of charging stations

```{r}
Fuel_Stations_Summary <- Fuel_Stations_PW %>%
  select(Station.Name, State, Latitude, Longitude, Open.Date) %>%
  mutate(
    Open.Date = year(dmy(Open.Date)),
    State = toupper(trimws(State)),
    # Full state name mapping including DC
    State = {
      abbr <- c(state.abb, "DC")
      names <- c(state.name, "District of Columbia")
      names[match(State, abbr)]
    }
  ) %>%
  filter(Open.Date >= 2016 & Open.Date <= 2023) %>%
  group_by(Year = Open.Date, State) %>%
  summarise(Number_of_Stations = n(), .groups = 'drop')

```


##Combining data:
```{r}
EV_Summary <- EV_Registrations_Subset_PW %>%
  select(Year, State, `Total_EV`)

Fuel_Station_and_Registrations_Combined <- left_join(
  Fuel_Stations_Summary, EV_Summary, by = c("Year", "State")
)
```

##Putting processed data into folder
```{r}

write.csv(EV_Summary, "Data/Processed/EV_Summary.csv", row.names = FALSE)

write.csv(Fuel_Stations_Summary, "Data/Processed/Fuel_Stations_Summary.csv", row.names = FALSE)

write.csv(Fuel_Station_and_Registrations_Combined, "Data/Processed/Fuel_Station_and_Registrations_Combined.csv", row.names = FALSE)


```

##Correlation 
```{r}
#Correlation analysis
cor_result <- cor(Cleaned_EV_Station_Data$Total_EV, Cleaned_EV_Station_Data$Number_of_Stations, method = "pearson")
print(cor_result)

#The correlation is high i.e. 0.8, it suggests a strong positive relationship: more stations = more EVs.


# Visualize with corrplot
cor_matrix <- Cleaned_EV_Station_Data %>%
  select(Total_EV, Number_of_Stations) %>%
  cor()

corrplot(cor_matrix, method = "circle", type = "upper", tl.col = "black", addCoef.col = "black")

#Scatter plot with trend line using ggplot
ggplot(Cleaned_EV_Station_Data, aes(x = Number_of_Stations, y = Total_EV)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6, color = "steelblue") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "darkred", se = TRUE) +
  labs(
    title = "Relationship Between EV Stations and Total EV Registrations",
    x = "Number of EV Charging Stations",
    y = "Total EV Registrations"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```


##Data analysis and linear regression
```{r}
# Step 1: Clean combined dataset for modeling
Cleaned_EV_Station_Data <- Fuel_Station_and_Registrations_Combined %>%
  filter(!is.na(Total_EV), !is.na(Number_of_Stations))
  

# Step 2: Project EV growth for 2024–2026
EV_Projections_By_State <- Cleaned_EV_Station_Data %>%
  group_by(State) %>%
  do({
    ev_model <- lm(Total_EV ~ Year, data = .)
    future_years <- data.frame(Year = 2024:2026)
    predicted_evs <- predict(ev_model, newdata = future_years)
    data.frame(State = unique(.$State), Year = future_years$Year, Total_EV = predicted_evs)
  }) %>%
  ungroup()

# Step 3: Predict required stations based on projected EV counts
Station_Predictions_By_State <- Cleaned_EV_Station_Data %>%
  group_by(State) %>%
  do({
    station_model <- lm(Number_of_Stations ~ Total_EV, data = .)
    state_evs <- EV_Projections_By_State %>% filter(State == unique(.$State))
    state_evs$Predicted_Stations <- predict(station_model, newdata = state_evs)
    state_evs
  }) %>%
  ungroup()

# Step 4: Final predictions table
Final_Projections_2024_2026 <- Station_Predictions_By_State %>%
  select(State, Year, Total_EV, Predicted_Stations)
```

##Graph plotting
```{r}
# Prepare historical data for plotting
Historical_Data <- Fuel_Station_and_Registrations_Combined %>%
  select(State, Year, Total_EV, Number_of_Stations) %>%
  mutate(Source = "Historical")

# Prepare projected data for plotting
Projected_Data <- Station_Predictions_By_State %>%
  rename(Number_of_Stations = Predicted_Stations) %>%
  mutate(Source = "Projected")

# Combine historical and projected data
Combined_Data_For_Plot <- bind_rows(Historical_Data, Projected_Data)

# Create the plot
ggplot(Combined_Data_For_Plot, aes(x = Total_EV, y = Number_of_Stations, color = Source)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~ State, scales = "free") +
  labs(
    title = "EV Stations vs. Total EV Registrations (2016–2026)",
    x = "Total EV Registrations",
    y = "Number of EV Stations",
    color = "Data Type"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(strip.text = element_text(face = "bold", size = 10))

```
