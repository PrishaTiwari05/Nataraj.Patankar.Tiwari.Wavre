## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
EV_Registrations_PW <- read_excel(
  path = here("Data/Raw/2016-2023 LDV Registration Data.xlsx"),
  col_names = TRUE
)

Fuel_Stations_PW <- read.csv(
file = here("Data/Raw/Fuel_Stations_Historical_Data.csv"),
stringsAsFactors = TRUE
)


```

## Data cleaning and filtering of EV registration

```{r}
EV_Registrations_Subset_PW <- EV_Registrations_PW %>%
  select(`Year`, `State`, `Electric (EV)`, `Plug-In Hybrid Electric (PHEV)`)

EV_Registrations_Subset_PW <- EV_Registrations_Subset_PW %>%
  arrange(Year)

```

## Data cleaning and filtering of charging stations

```{r}

# Keep only the required columns
Fuel_Stations_PW <- Fuel_Stations_PW[, c("Station.Name", "State", "Latitude", "Longitude", "Open.Date")]

Fuel_Stations_PW$Open.Date <- dmy(Fuel_Stations_PW$Open.Date)

Fuel_Stations_PW$Open.Date <- year(Fuel_Stations_PW$Open.Date)

Fuel_Stations_PW <- subset(Fuel_Stations_PW, Open.Date >= 2016 & Open.Date <= 2023)

# First, ensure everything is uppercase and trimmed
Fuel_Stations_PW$State <- toupper(trimws(Fuel_Stations_PW$State))

# Create a lookup: abbreviation â†’ full name
state_abbr <- state.abb
state_names <- state.name

# Add DC manually
state_abbr <- c(state_abbr, "DC")
state_names <- c(state_names, "District of Columbia")

# Map the abbreviations to full names
Fuel_Stations_PW$State <- state_names[match(Fuel_Stations_PW$State, state_abbr)]
```

## Data Wrangling

```{r}

# Adding a new column with EV + PHEV count. 
EV_Registrations_Subset_PW$`Total EVs` <- 
  EV_Registrations_Subset_PW$`Electric (EV)` + 
  EV_Registrations_Subset_PW$`Plug-In Hybrid Electric (PHEV)`

```

```{r}

Station_Counts <- Fuel_Stations_PW %>%
  group_by(Open.Date, State) %>%
  summarise(Number_of_Stations = n(), .groups = 'drop')

```

```{r}

# 1. Summarize station counts by Year and State
Fuel_Stations_Summary <- Fuel_Stations_PW %>%
  group_by(Open.Date, State) %>%
  summarise(Number_of_Stations = n(), .groups = 'drop') %>%
  rename(Year = Open.Date)  # Rename for joining

# 2. Select required columns from EV registrations
EV_Summary <- EV_Registrations_Subset_PW %>%
  select(Year, State, `Total EVs`)

# 3. Join on Year and State
Combined_Data <- left_join(
  Fuel_Stations_Summary,
  EV_Summary,
  by = c("Year", "State")
)

```
