## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
EV_Registrations_PW <- read_excel(
  path = here("Data/Raw/2016-2023 LDV Registration Data.xlsx"),
  col_names = TRUE
)

Fuel_Stations_PW <- read.csv(
file = here("Data/Raw/Fuel_Stations_Historical_Data.csv"),
stringsAsFactors = TRUE
)


```

## Data cleaning

```{r}
EV_Registrations_Subset_PW <- EV_Registrations_PW %>%
  select(`Year`, `State`, `Electric (EV)`, `Plug-In Hybrid Electric (PHEV)`)

# Keep only the required columns
Fuel_Stations_PW <- Fuel_Stations_PW[, c("Station.Name", "State", "Latitude", "Longitude", "Open.Date")]

# Convert Open.Date to Date format and extract year
Fuel_Stations_PW$Open.Date <- format(as.Date(Fuel_Stations_PW$Open.Date, format = "%m/%d/%Y"), "%Y")

```
## Data Wrangling

```{r}

# Adding a new column with EV + PHEV count. 
EV_Registrations_Subset_PW$`Total EVs` <- 
  EV_Registrations_Subset_PW$`Electric (EV)` + 
  EV_Registrations_Subset_PW$`Plug-In Hybrid Electric (PHEV)`

```
## Data Filter

```{r}
# Convert Open.Date to numeric 
Fuel_Stations_PW$Open.Date <- as.numeric(Fuel_Stations_PW$Open.Date)

# Filter for years 2016 to 2023
Fuel_Stations_PW <- subset(Fuel_Stations_PW, Open.Date >= 2016 & Open.Date <= 2023)
