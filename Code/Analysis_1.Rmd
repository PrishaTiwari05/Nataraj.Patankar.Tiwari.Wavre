## Number of EVs vs Average income of States

In this part of our analysis, we explore whether the average income of a state is correlated to the number of electric vehicles sold in that state. To do so, we will start by cleaning our data, conducting a correlation test, and then creating a correlation plot. 

```{r analysis 1 part 2}
#Loading Packages 
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(ggplot2)
library(corrplot)
library(readxl)

here()

#Cleaning Data
EV_Data_PT <- read_excel("Data/Raw/2016-2023 LDV Registration Data.xlsx")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
