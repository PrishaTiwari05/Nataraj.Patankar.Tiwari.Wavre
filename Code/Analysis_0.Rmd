## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r Packages and Theme, warning=FALSE}
#1 Loading Packages
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(here)
library(cowplot)
installed.packages("readxl")
library("readxl")

#2 Setting Theme
mytheme <- theme_grey(base_size = 14)+
  theme(axis.text = element_text(color = "black"),legend.position = "bottom")
theme_set(mytheme)

# Getting Working Directory
getwd()
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r Datasets, echo=TRUE}
#3

LDVRegistration_AP <- read_excel(path=here("Data/Raw/2016-2023 LDV Registration Data.xlsx"))
summary(LDVRegistration_AP)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
